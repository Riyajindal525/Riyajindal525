<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Riya</h1>  
<p align="center">  
Aspiring MERN Stack Developer |  Tech Enthusiast | CSE’28  
</p> 
   
## 👩‍💻 About Me    

A passionate **Computer Science Engineering student (CSE’28)** from India with a deep love for **problem  solving**  and building **impactful web  applications**.   

🔹 My journey began with curiosity about how websites and software work, evolving into a drive to master both **fundamentals and latest web development tools**.  
 
🔹 Ever since writing my first **“Hello World” in C**, I’ve been hooked on bringing technology to life.  

🔹 From **C and C++** for logic and discipline, I moved on to **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap**, enjoying the creative process.  

🔹 Today, I’m exploring the **MERN Stack** to develop **scalable, dynamic applications** that solve real-world problems.  

### 🚀 Highlights from my work
- **Mahabharata Website** — Multi-language platform (Hindi, English, Sanskrit) combining cultural depth with modern UI.  
- **Spotify Clone** — Responsive web app for seamless music streaming.  
- **Simon Says Game** — Fun, interactive memory game using JavaScript.  
- **All-in-One Converter** — Quick and clean tool for unit, currency, and temperature conversions.  
- **Cooking Website** — User-friendly recipe platform with easy navigation.  

🔹 For me, coding is more than just writing lines of code — it’s about **solving problems, telling stories, and building something that leaves an impact**.  

🔹 Every project is a stepping stone, every bug a challenge, and every finished product a reason to dream bigger.  

🤝 Let’s connect — I’m always open to collaboration or talking about **technology, ideas, and innovation**.
